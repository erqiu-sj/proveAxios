# proveAxios

## install

`npm i @zealforchange/proveaxios`

or

`yarn add @zealforchange/proveaxios`

## why is there this?

```
We are tired of watching and writing various axios request configurations!

before this, I always copied the axios configuration from another project to another project

this kind of mechanical operation makes me feel tired, I always think about how to break the game

until his appearance --- proveAxios
